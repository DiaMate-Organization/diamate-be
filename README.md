# Diamate Backend

Backend API for the **Diamate** project, an early detection application for diabetes. This backend is built using Node.js version 21 with pnpm as the package manager, and uses Docker for easy running across different environments.


---

## Technologies Used

* Node.js 21 (Debian Bullseye-based)
* pnpm as package manager
* Supabase (backend-as-a-service)
* TensorFlow\.js with native addons (@tensorflow/tfjs-node)
* Docker for containerization and deployment

---

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```
PORT=5000
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
```

---

## How to Build and Run Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image**

```bash
docker build -t diamate-backend .
```

2. **Run the Docker Container**

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 5000:5000 diamate-backend
```

* The `--env-file .env` option injects environment variables from the `.env` file.
* Port 5000 inside the container is mapped to port 5000 on the host machine.

## Dockerfile Explanation

```
FROM node:21-bullseye

RUN corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml* ./

RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Rebuild TensorFlow native addon so it works properly inside the container  
RUN pnpm exec npm rebuild @tensorflow/tfjs-node --build-addon-from-source

COPY . .

RUN pnpm run build

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["pnpm", "run", "start"]
```

* The base image `node:21-bullseye` is chosen for compatibility with native modules.
* Corepack is enabled to manage pnpm versions.
* Dependencies are installed consistently with the frozen lockfile flag.
* TensorFlow native addon is rebuilt inside the container to avoid runtime errors.
* Source code is copied and built.
* Port 5000 is exposed for the app.
* The app is started with `pnpm run start`.

---

## Important Notes

* If you use other native modules, add rebuild commands in the Dockerfile to prevent runtime errors.
* Supabase URL and Anon Key must be valid for the backend to connect to Supabase services.
* The port in `.env` should match the exposed port in the Dockerfile and the port mapped when running the container.
